E-Office is a project proposed to make the automation in the work of mannual works in the offices.
It will include the circulation of documents from one department to another i.e. From one authority
to another authority, So as to reduce the time and paper work that wastes on doing the work
manually and to make the process of circulating the documents faster.
E-File, is a workflow based system that replaces the existing manual handling of files with a more
efficient electronic system. This system involves all stages, including the diarisation of inward
receipts, creation of files, movement of receipts and files and finally, the archival of records. With
this system, the movement of receipts and files becomes seamless and there is more transparency
in the system since each and every action taken on a file is recorded electronically.
This simplifies decision making, as all the required information is available at a single point. It
envisions a paperless office, with increased transparency, efficiency and accountability of the
organization.
